# Mode: EXPLOIT

Execution mode. Full constraint stack. Zero deviation.

---

## Activation

```markdown
## Mode: EXPLOIT

Creativity: disabled
Deviation: none without approval
Verification: mandatory after each change
```

---

## Purpose

Use EXPLOIT when:

- Implementing approved design
- Following defined specification
- Executing known procedure
- Making precise changes
- Bug fix with clear solution
- Refactoring per plan

---

## Characteristics

| Aspect        | EXPLOIT Behavior   |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Creativity    | ❌ Disabled        |
| Options       | ❌ One path only   |
| Questions     | ⚠️ Only if blocked |
| Deviation     | ❌ Zero tolerance  |
| Output format | 📋 Exact match     |
| Uncertainty   | ❌ Unacceptable    |

---

## Full Constraint Stack

All 5 layers enforced:

### Layer 1: Identity

- Stay in assigned role
- No persona drift

### Layer 2: Three Laws

- Sub-agent when threshold met
- Document before terminate
- Quality gates immutable

### Layer 3: ALWAYS/NEVER

- All items strictly enforced
- Binary, no exceptions

### Layer 4: Phases/Gates

- Sequential execution only
- Every gate must pass
- No phase skip

### Layer 5: Output Format

- Exact structure required
- Match template precisely

---

## Verification Requirements

After each action:

```markdown
## Verification

- [ ] Action matches spec
- [ ] No unintended changes
- [ ] Tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Gate conditions met

Result: {PASS | FAIL}
```

### On Failure

1. Revert action
2. Diagnose issue
3. Retry with correction
4. Escalate after 3 attempts

---

## What's Enforced

| Constraint            | Status in EXPLOIT |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Exact output format   | Mandatory         |
| Single-path execution | Required          |
| Sequential phases     | Required          |
| Spec compliance       | 100%              |
| Verification          | After each step   |

---

## Output Patterns

### Implementation Output

```markdown
# Implementation: {component}

## Files Created

- `{path}`: {purpose}

## Files Modified

- `{path}`: {change}

## Verification

- [ ] Code compiles/runs
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Style consistent

## Deviations

{none if spec followed, else document with rationale}
```

### Handoff Output

```markdown
# Handoff: {task}

## Completed

- {list of completed items}

## Artifacts

- {artifact}: {location}

## Verification

- Status: PASS
- Evidence: {test output/file existence}

## Next Steps

{if any remain}
```

---

## Mode Transition

### EXPLOIT → EXPLORE Trigger

When:

- Unexpected blocker found
- Specification unclear
- Scope expansion needed
- High uncertainty encountered

```markdown
Blocker found → Uncertainty high → MODE: EXPLORE (temporary)
```

### Signal in Output

```markdown
## BLOCKED

{description of block}

⚠️ Switching to EXPLORE mode to investigate.
Will return to EXPLOIT once resolved.
```

After EXPLORE resolves → return to EXPLOIT.

---

## Example Dispatch

```markdown
# Task: Implement auth service per design

## Mode: EXPLOIT

Creativity: disabled
Deviation: none
Reference: .ai/scratch/design/auth_design.md

## Scope

IN: src/auth/ directory only
OUT: Everything else

## Deliverables

- Auth service implementation
- Unit tests
- \_handoff.md

## Constraints

- Follow design exactly
- No additional features
- Verify after each file
```

---

## Summary

```
EXPLOIT = Do the thing right

❌ Creativity off
❌ No deviation
✅ Verification required
📋 Exact output format
🔒 Full constraint stack

Transition: Blocker → EXPLORE (temporary) → back to EXPLOIT
```
